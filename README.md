# ferret-go

This is a failed attempt to replace the [ferret](https://github.com/cooper/ferret) runtime (which is written in Perl) with one written in Go.
I am not sure how to continue with its development because Go lacks weak reference support and proper inheritance. I may return to this if I experience a revelation on how to work around these issues.
